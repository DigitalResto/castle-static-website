      "The food and ambience is quite good. No much rush and the service is fair. The prices are okay and the quantity is also reasonable. Best item to try would be the different kinds of Mandi rices. They are super tasty. It is on the side of a very busy road but fortunately they have a good parking ground behind their building which will be quite useful for people coming in bike or car.",
